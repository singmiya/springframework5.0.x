/**
 * Extension of the {@link BeanFactory} interface to be implemented by bean factories
 * that can enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup
 * by name one by one as requested by clients. BeanFactory implementations that
 * preload all their bean definitions (such as XML-based factories) may implement
 * this interface.
 *
 * BeanFactory接口的扩展，此扩展由可以枚举所有bean实例的bean工厂实现，而不是根据客户端请求按照名称一一尝试查找bean。
 * 需要实现预加载所有bean定义（例如，基于XML的工厂）的BeanFactory可能需要实现此接口。
 *
 * <p>If this is a {@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}, the return values will <i>not</i>
 * take any BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans
 * defined in the current factory. Use the {@link BeanFactoryUtils} helper class
 * to consider beans in ancestor factories too.
 *
 * 如果这是HierarchicalBeanFactory，返回值将不会将任何BeanFactory层次结构考虑在内，仅会将与当前工厂定义的bean相关联。
 * 也可以使用BeanFactoryUtils帮助类把祖先工厂中的bean考虑在内。
 *
 * <p>The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory.
 * They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}'s
 * {@code registerSingleton} method, with the exception of
 * {@code getBeanNamesOfType} and {@code getBeansOfType} which will check
 * such manually registered singletons too. Of course, BeanFactory's {@code getBean}
 * does allow transparent access to such special beans as well. However, in typical
 * scenarios, all beans will be defined by external bean definitions anyway, so most
 * applications don't need to worry about this differentiation.
 *
 * 该接口中的方法仅遵守此工厂中的bean定义。它们将会忽略由其他方式注册的任何单例bean（像ConfigurableBeanFactory的registerSingleton方法），
 * 除了getBeanNamesOfType和getBeansOfType之外，它们也会检查此类手动注册的单例。
 * 当然，BeanFactory的getBean方法也允许透明的访问此类特殊bean。然而，在典型场景下，无论如何，所有的bean都将通过外部bean定义来定义，
 * 因此，大部分应用都不需要担心此类差异。
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> With the exception of {@code getBeanDefinitionCount}
 * and {@code containsBeanDefinition}, the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.
 *
 * 注意：除了getBeanDefinitionCount和containsBeanDefinition之外，此接口中的方法不适合频繁调用。其实现（运行速度）可能比较慢。
